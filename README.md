# Machine-Learning---based-web-application-firewall-for-intrusion-prevention.
This project presents a Machine Learning-based Web Application Firewall (WAF) for Intrusion Prevention, designed to intelligently detect and prevent web-based cyber-attacks in real-time. Unlike traditional firewalls that rely on static rule sets, this system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze incoming HTTP requests and classify them as either legitimate or malicious. By training on publicly available intrusion datasets, the firewall can identify common web attacks such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and more complex intrusion patterns. 

The project is built using Python with Flask for the backend, and the machine learning components are developed using Scikit-learn and Pandas. The system provides a lightweight, adaptable, and efficient layer of security that continuously learns and improves with new data, offering a modern, automated solution to web application protection. This firewall is intended to be integrated with existing web servers to provide real-time filtering, and it can be further expanded to include cloud integration, advanced visualization dashboards, and deep learning-based detection techniques.
